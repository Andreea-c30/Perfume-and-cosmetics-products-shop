When it comes to skin care, your lips don’t often get the pampering they deserve. While you might stay on top of the latest lipstick shades and formulas, that doesn’t mean you’re giving your lips all the TLC they need. Sure, there may be a lip balm or two tucked inside your purse or lying around in your bathroom shelf, but if you really want to get serious about maintaining a perfect pout, it’s time to take a closer look at your lip products.

  <h2 class="text-center">Why Lip Care Is Important</h2>
  <hr>
<p>Just like your skin, your lips needs consistent care. That’s because your lips don’t have sweat or oil glands, which means they don’t get the added protection that your skin’s natural moisture provides.</p>
<p>This is also why they are prone to chapping, cracking, and feeling dry. Not to mention, they are made of the thinnest skin in your body, making them even more susceptible to damage when exposed to the elements and the sun.</p>

How to Choose the Right Lip Products
</h2>

<p>
Luckily, your lip care options are no longer limited to the glitter glosses and chapsticks of your tween years. Whether you’re eyeing a tint, balm or stain, it’s best to choose multitasking products that add natural-looking color with a healthy dose of moisture and protection.
   </p>
<p>
As far as ingredients are concerned, Anna H. Chacon, a board-certified dermatologist in Weston, Fla., says SPF should be your priority. “A lip balm with sun protection is the ideal product. A lip conditioner is also helpful at keeping [lips] supple,” she adds.

When it comes to adding and locking in moisture to your lips, look for the usual hydrating ingredients that you typically find in your skin care products. These include hyaluronic acid, vitamins A, C and E, aloe vera and nourishing oils.
